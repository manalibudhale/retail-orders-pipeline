# Project: Retail order end-to-end pipeline

This project is focused on analyzing retail order data using an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. The primary objective is to assist a retail business in understanding product sales performance, regional differences, seasonal sales trends, and growth opportunities. Initially, the data was extracted using the Kaggle API. The dataset was downloaded directly from Kaggle using Python, which involved authenticating with the Kaggle API, locating the dataset, and saving it to the local environment for further processing. This automated data extraction ensures that the source is reliable and the process is repeatable.

After extracting the data, the next step was the transformation phase. The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for cleaning and preprocessing. During this phase, unnecessary columns were dropped, missing values were handled, and data types were corrected. For example, the order_date field was converted into datetime format so that it could be used for time-based analysis later on. New columns were created where necessary, such as extracting the year and month from the order date. This step was important because it allowed for better aggregation and grouping of sales data over time. The data was also checked for duplicates, and any inconsistencies were cleaned to maintain the quality and accuracy of the results.

Once the data was prepared, it was loaded into a format suitable for analysis, including exporting the cleaned dataset to a CSV file. This file was then used as the source table (df_orders) for SQL-based analysis. Several SQL queries were written to explore the data and extract business insights. One of the key insights was identifying the top 10 products that generated the highest revenue. This helps the business understand which products are performing best. The analysis also included identifying the top 5 selling products in each region, which is helpful for regional marketing and stock decisions.

The project further analyzed month-over-month sales growth for the years 2022 and 2023. This allowed the business to see how sales are changing over time and whether there is consistent growth or seasonal patterns. Additionally, the analysis revealed the month with the highest sales for each product category, which is useful for planning promotions or increasing inventory ahead of peak seasons. Lastly, a comparison of sales between 2022 and 2023 at the sub-category level showed which product sub-category had the most significant growth. This highlights new opportunities for investment and helps in setting future sales targets.

Overall, this project shows how raw data can be turned into valuable insights using an ETL approach. From downloading the dataset via API, cleaning and transforming the data in Python, and performing detailed analysis using SQL, each step was carefully designed to support better business decision-making in the retail domain.
